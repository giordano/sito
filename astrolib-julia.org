[[http://julialang.org/][Julia]] is a modern programming language, focussed on high-performance and
particularly useful for technical and scientific computing.

[[https://github.com/giordano/AstroLib.jl][~AstroLib.jl~]] is a package of small generic routines useful above all in
astronomical and astrophysical context, written in Julia.

Included are also translations of some [[http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/homepage.html][IDL Astronomy User's Library]] (also known
as AstroLib) procedures, which are released under terms of [[http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/idlfaq.html#A14][BSD-2-Clause License]].
~AstroLib.jl~'s functions are not drop-in replacement of those procedures, Julia
standard data types are often used (e.g., ~DateTime~ type instead of generic
string for dates) and the syntax may slightly differ.

An extensive error testing suite ensures old fixed bugs will not be brought back
by future changes.

** Install

~AstroLib.jl~ is available for Julia 0.4 and later versions, and can be
installed with [[http://docs.julialang.org/en/stable/manual/packages/][Julia built-in package manager]]. In a Julia session run the
command

#+BEGIN_SRC julia
julia> Pkg.add("AstroLib")
#+END_SRC

You may need to update your package list with ~Pkg.update()~ in order to
get the latest version of ~AstroLib.jl~.

** Usage

After installing the package, you can start using ~AstroLib.jl~ with
#+BEGIN_SRC julia
using AstroLib
#+END_SRC

** Documentation

Every function provided has detailed documentation that can be
[[http://docs.julialang.org/en/stable/manual/documentation/#accessing-documentation][accessed]]
at Julia REPL with
#+BEGIN_SRC julia
julia> ?FunctionName
#+END_SRC
or with
#+BEGIN_SRC julia
julia> @doc FunctionName
#+END_SRC

Full documentation of all functions can be read on-line at
https://astrolibjl.readthedocs.org/.

** Development

~AstroLib.jl~ is developed on GitHub at
[[https://github.com/giordano/AstroLib.jl]]. You can contribute by
providing new functions, reporting bugs, and improving documentation.

** Related Projects

This is not the only effort to bundle astronomical functions written in Julia
language. Other packages useful for more specific purposes are available at
[[https://juliaastro.github.io/]].

In addition, there are similar projects for Python ([[http://www.hs.uni-hamburg.de/DE/Ins/Per/Czesla/PyA/PyA/pyaslDoc/pyasl.html][Python AstroLib]]) and R
([[http://rpackages.ianhowson.com/cran/astrolibR/][Astronomy Users Library]]).

original author is Mos√® Giordano.

** Notes

This project is a work-in-progress, only few procedures have been translated so
far. In addition, function syntax may change from time to time. Check [[https://github.com/giordano/AstroLib.jl/blob/master/TODO.md][TODO.md]]
out to see how you can help. Volunteers are welcome!
