** Introduction

=PolynomialRoots.jl= is a library for finding roots of complex polynomials,
written in [[http://julialang.org/][Julia]].

This is an implementation in Julia of the [[http://www.astrouw.edu.pl/~jskowron/cmplx_roots_sg/][General Complex Polynomial Root
Solver]], written in Fortran, by *Jan Skowron* and *Andrew Gould*. All the credits
goes to them for the original algorithm.

The root finding algorithm employed in this library is described in

-  J. Skowron & A. Gould, 2012, "General Complex Polynomial Root Solver and Its
  Further Optimization for Binary Microlenses", [[http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.1034][arXiv:1203.1034]]

This algorithm aims to be fast and precise, more than the well known =zroots=
procedure described in /Numerical Recipes/ books, whose implementations in C and
Fortran are not available as free software, according to the [[https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html][definition]] of the
Free Software Foundation.

=PolynomialRoots.jl= can also take advantage of native arbitrary precision
capabilities of Julia and achieve more precise results.

*Note*: the adopted algorithm can give highly inaccurate results for polynomials
of order above ~30. This can be mitigated by using multiple precision
calculations (see example below).

** Installation

=PolynomialRoots.jl= is available for Julia 0.4 and later versions, and can be
installed with [[http://docs.julialang.org/en/stable/manual/packages/][Julia built-in package manager]].  In a Julia session run the
command

#+BEGIN_SRC julia
Pkg.add("PolynomialRoots")
#+END_SRC

You may need to update your package list with =Pkg.update()= in order to get the
latest version of =PolynomialRoots.jl=.

** Usage

After installing the package, run

#+BEGIN_SRC julia
using PolynomialRoots
#+END_SRC

or put this command into your Julia script.

=PolynomialRoots.jl= provides two functions to find the roots of complex
polynomials

#+BEGIN_SRC julia
roots(polynomial[, roots, polish=true, epsilon=1e-20])
roots5(polynomial[, roots, epsilon=1e-20])
#+END_SRC

=roots= can be used to solve polynomials of any degree, =roots5= is tailored to
(and works only for) polynomials of degree 5. This function exists because [[http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/309566][one
of the methods]] to calculate [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_microlensing][gravitational microlensing]] amplification by a binary
lens requires solving a fifth-order complex polynomial. =roots5= should be more
robust than =roots= for this class of polynomials.

The mandatory argument for both functions is:

- =polynomial=, the vector holding coefficients of the polynomial you want to
  solve, in ascending order, from the lowest to the highest.  Coefficients can
  be complex and real

Optional arguments are:

- =roots=: if you roughly know in advance the position of the roots, you can
  pass the vector with the known roots to speed up convergence.  =roots= vector
  must be one element shorther than =polynomial=. In =roots5=, the roots will be
  only polished. Elements of the vector can be complex and real
- =polish= (boolean keyword, only for =roots=): if set to =true=, after all
  roots have been found by dividing original polynomial by each root found, all
  roots will be polished using full polynomial. Default is =false=
- =epsilon= (floating point optional keyword): this is used to determine the
  stopping criterion described in Skowron & Gould paper.  If not set, it
  defaults to machine precision of =polynomial= (and =roots=) argument(s). This
  is /not/ the precision with which the roots will be calculated.

The functions return in output the =Complex= vector with all roots of
=polynomial=.  *Note:* if =roots= optional argument is provided, it is /not/
changed in-place.

** Examples

Find the roots of

$$ (x - i)(x - 2)(x - 3i)(x - 4)(x - 5i) = x^5 - (9i + 6)x^4 + (54i - 15)x^3 + (138 - 57i)x^2 - (184 + 90i)x + 120i $$

This is a fifth-order polynomial, so we can find its zeros with both =roots= and
=roots5=:

#+BEGIN_SRC julia
roots([120im, -(184 + 90im), (138 - 57im), (54im - 15), -(6 + 9im), 1])
# => 5-element Array{Complex{Float64},1}:
#     -1.55431e-15+5.0im
#     4.0+1.77636e-16im
#      1.55028e-15+3.0im
#     -1.04196e-16+1.0im
#     2.0-2.00595e-16im

roots5([120im, -(184 + 90im), (138 - 57im), (54im - 15), -(6 + 9im), 1])
# => 5-element Array{Complex{Float64},1}:
#      5.92119e-16+5.0im
#      4.0-1.4803e-16im
#     2.0+1.88202e-16im
#     -1.88738e-15+3.0im
#      2.10942e-15+1.0im
#+END_SRC

=PolynomialRoots.jl= handles polynomials with high-multiplicity roots as
well.  For example, consider

$$ (x + 1)^5 = x^5 + 5x^4 + 10x^3 + 10x^2 + 5x + 1 $$

You can find its roots with

#+BEGIN_SRC julia
roots([1, 5, 10, 10, 5, 1])
# => 5-element Array{Complex{Float64},1}:
#     -1.0+0.0im
#     -1.0+0.0im
#     -1.0+0.0im
#     -1.0+0.0im
#     -1.0+0.0im

roots5([1, 5, 10, 10, 5, 1])
# => 5-element Array{Complex{Float64},1}:
#     -1.0+0.0im
#     -1.0+0.0im
#     -1.0+0.0im
#     -1.0+0.0im
#     -1.0+0.0im
#+END_SRC

*** Arbitrary precision

Due to limited precision of =Float64= type, extraction of roots of polynomials
can give inaccurate results, even for low-order polynomials.  This is caused,
i.e., by [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_of_significance][catastrophic cancellation]] in computation of discriminant $\Delta =
\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}$ of second-order polynomials.  [[http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/Qdrtcs.pdf][For example]], the actual roots of

$$ 94906265.625x^2 - 189812534x + 94906268.375 $$

are

$$ x_1 = 1.000000028975958 \\
   x_2 = 1.000000000000000 $$

but when you try to calculate them in double-precision you get

#+BEGIN_SRC julia
r = roots([94906268.375, -189812534, 94906265.625]);
r[1]
# => 1.0000000144879793 - 0.0im
r[2]
# => 1.0000000144879788 + 0.0im
#+END_SRC

If you are interested in double-precision accuracy, you can work around this
problem by calculating the roots with higher precision and then transforming the
result to double-precision.  Julia natively supports multiple precision
calculations, so what you have to do is only to pass =BigFloat= numbers to
=roots= function:

#+BEGIN_SRC julia
r = roots([BigFloat(94906268.375), BigFloat(-189812534), BigFloat(94906265.625)]);

Float64(r[1])
# => 1.0000000289759583

Float64(r[2])
# => 1.0
#+END_SRC

Note that in this case there is a trade-off between speed and higher accuracy
and precision.

** Related projects

Another Julia package for finding roots of complex polynomials is
[[https://github.com/Keno/Polynomials.jl][=Polynomials.jl=]], by Jameson Nash and other contributors. This package does much
more than finding roots of polynomials (among other features, it can integrate
and differentiate polynomials).  In order to solve the polynomial,
=Polynomials.jl= calculates eigenvalues of its companion matrix, but
=PolynomialRoots.jl= is usually faster by up to an order of magnitude and often
slightly more precise.  In addition, =Polynomials= cannot extract roots in
arbitrary precision.  If you are after speed and precision, =PolynomialRoots.jl=
can still be a better option.
