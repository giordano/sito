#+TITLE: Deconvolution.jl
#+SUBTITLE: Package for deconvolution of digital signals
#+STARTUP: showall
#+LANGUAGE: en

* Introduction

[[https://github.com/JuliaDSP/Deconvolution.jl][Deconvolution.jl]] provides a set of functions to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deconvolution][deconvolve]] digital signals, like
images or time series.  This is written in [[http://julialang.org/][Julia]], a modern high-level,
high-performance dynamic programming language designed for technical computing.

* Installation

=Deconvolution.jl= is available for Julia 0.4 and later versions, and can be
installed with [[http://docs.julialang.org/en/stable/manual/packages/][Julia built-in package manager]]. In a Julia session run the
commands

#+BEGIN_SRC julia
julia> Pkg.update()
julia> Pkg.add("Deconvolution")
#+END_SRC

** Documentation

The complete manual of =Deconvolution.jl= is available at
http://deconvolutionjl.readthedocs.io. It has more detailed explanation of the
methods used and the examples are complemented with pictures. You can also
download the PDF version of the manual from
https://media.readthedocs.org/pdf/deconvolutionjl/latest/deconvolutionjl.pdf.

* Usage

Currently =Deconvolution.jl= provides only one methd, but others will come in
the future.

** =wiener=

#+BEGIN_SRC julia
wiener(input, signal, noise[, blurring])
#+END_SRC

The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_deconvolution][Wiener deconvolution]] attempts at reducing the noise in a digital signal by
suppressing frequencies with low [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal-to-noise_ratio][signal-to-noise ratio]]. The signal is assumed to
be degraded by additive noise and a shift-invariant blurring function.

The =wiener= function can be used to apply the Wiener deconvolution method to a
digital signal. The arguments are:

- =input=: the digital signal
- =signal=: the original signal (or a signal with a luckily similar
  power spectrum)
- =noise=: the noise of the signal (or a noise with a luckily similar
  power spectrum)
- =blurring= (optional argument): the blurring kernel

All arguments must be arrays, all with the same size, and all of them in the
time/space domain (they will be converted to the frequency domain internally
using =fft= function). Argument =noise= can be also a real number, in which case
a constant noise with that value will be assumed (this is a good approximation
in the case of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_noise][white noise]]).

* Examples

** Wiener deconvolution

Here is an example of use of =wiener= function to perform the Wiener
deconvolution of an image, degraded with a blurring function and an additive
noise.

#+BEGIN_SRC julia
using Images, TestImages, Deconvolution, ImageView

# Open the test image
img = float(data(testimage("cameraman")))'
# Create the blurring kernel in frequency domain
x = hcat(ntuple(x -> collect((1:512) - 257), 512)...)
k = 0.001
blurring_ft = exp(-k*(x .^ 2 + x' .^ 2).^(5//6))
# Create additive noise
noise = rand(size(img))
# Fourier transform of the blurred image, with additive noise
blurred_img_ft = fftshift(blurring_ft) .* fft(img) + fft(noise)
# Get the blurred image from its Fourier transform
blurred_img = real(ifft(blurred_img_ft))
# Get the blurring kernel in the space domain
blurring = ifft(fftshift(blurring_ft))
# Polish the image with Deconvolution deconvolution
polished = wiener(blurred_img, img, noise, blurring)

# Wiener deconvolution works also when you don't have the real image and noise,
# that is the most common and useful case.  This happens because the Wiener
# filter only cares about the power spectrum of the signal and the noise, so you
# don't need to have the exact signal and noise but something with a similar
# power spectrum.
img2 = float(data(testimage("livingroom"))) # Load another image
noise2 = rand(size(img)) # Create another additive noise
# Polish the image with Deconvolution deconvolution
polished2 = wiener(blurred_img, img2, noise2, blurring)

# Compare...
view(img) # ...the original image
view(blurred_img) # ...the blurred image
view(polished) # ...the polished image
view(polished2) # ...the second polished image
